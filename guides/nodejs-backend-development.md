Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on our machine instead of just the browser. This allows us to use Javascript to build backend apis and write server side code.

### Introduction to Backend Development

A typical web or mobile app consists of 2 parts.

1. A frontend: This is the user Interface you see and interact with (checkout my complete guide here: [Frontend Web Development: Complete Beginner's Guide](https://resourcify.me/guides/web-frontend-ultimate))
2. **A backend**: This is the code that runs on the server and provides the frontend with the data and resource it needs to run. It responds tp the requests of the frontend by providing the required data.
